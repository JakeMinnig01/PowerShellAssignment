# PowerShellAssignment
## üìÑ Description
This script (`MyApp.ps1`) reads a comma-separated values (CSV) file from disk and outputs **numeric**, **alphabetic**, or **both** types of values based on user input. It also supports **sorting** in either ascending or descending order.

This script was created as part of a technical assignment and demonstrates parameter handling, string parsing, filtering, sorting, and basic error handling in PowerShell.
